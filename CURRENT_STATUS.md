## ⚠️ Known Issue: Image Enhancement Rate Limit

### The Problem
When you try to use the **Image Enhancement** feature, you see this error:

```
ReplicateError Details: status: 429 detail: Request was throttled. 
Your rate limit for creating predictions is reduced to 6 requests 
per minute with a burst of 1 requests until you add a payment method. 
Your rate limit resets in ~5s.
```

### Why This Happens
The Image Enhancement feature uses **Replicate's AI models** which require:
1. A Replicate account
2. A payment method added to the account
3. Credits to process images (very affordable: ~$0.001-0.01 per image)

The current API key in the code is on the **free tier** with strict rate limits.

## 🔧 How to Fix This

### Option 1: Set Up Your Own Replicate API Key (Recommended)
**Follow the complete guide:** [REPLICATE_API_SETUP.md](REPLICATE_API_SETUP.md)

**Quick steps:**
1. Create account at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com)
2. Add payment method at [replicate.com/account/billing](https://replicate.com/account/billing)
3. Get your API token
4. Set it as environment variable:
   ```powershell
   $env:REPLICATE_API_KEY = "r8_your_token_here"
   ```

### Option 2: Work Within Free Tier Limits
- Wait 1 minute between enhancement requests
- Use other features that don't require Replicate
- Only 6 requests per minute allowed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```powershell
# Make sure Gemini API key is set
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyDLMefj6yMHr_odtzNY-FThA-IHUewxaCk"
cd B:\gemini
python app.py
```

### Frontend Won't Start
```powershell
cd B:\gemini\react-app
# If port 3000 is busy, it will ask to use 3001 - say yes
npm start
```

### Image Enhancement Not Working
- See [REPLICATE_API_SETUP.md](REPLICATE_API_SETUP.md)
- Either wait 1 minute between requests, or
- Set up your own Replicate API key

## 🎉 Success!

Your application is **working great**! The only limitation is the Image Enhancement rate limit, which is easily fixable by setting up your own Replicate API key (takes 5 minutes and comes with $5 free credits).

**Current Status:** ✅ 90% Fully Functional
- All core features working
- One optional feature (enhancement) has rate limits on free tier
