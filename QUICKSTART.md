## üí° Example Analysis Output

**Input:** A photo of a sunset over mountains

**Output:**
```
This image captures a breathtaking sunset over a mountain range.
The sky is painted in vibrant shades of orange, pink, and purple,
creating a dramatic backdrop. Silhouettes of pine trees frame the
foreground, adding depth to the composition. The scene conveys a
sense of peace and natural beauty, typical of wilderness photography.
