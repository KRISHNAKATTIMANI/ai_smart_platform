$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"
python app.py
```

### API Calls Failing?
1. Check Flask is running on port 5000

3. Verify CORS is enabled in `app.py`

### Styles Not Showing?
```powershell
cd react-app
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

colors: {
  primary: '#4F46E5',  // Change this!
}
```
